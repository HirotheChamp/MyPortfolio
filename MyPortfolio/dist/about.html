                        Hello! My name is Kyle Young and I am starting my career as a Software Developer. I have been working 10+ years in customer service related jobs and figured 
                        it was time to switch career paths. I am a college graduate with a BA in Cinematography, a field I was incredibly passionate in when I was younger. I would soon pick up music
                        after college and pursued this difficult field for some time. Along the way, I was asked to be apart of a group of talented and intelligent individuals who shared similar goals.
                        The team I work with has created a business known as Elevated Common Ground (ECG for short), a business that has been 
                        throwing successful shows ever since. Although finding some success, I was not satisfied with developing one skill and turned to coding as a result.
