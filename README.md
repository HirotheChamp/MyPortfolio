## Background
Organization can be the difference between success and coming up short. For this reason, I decided to create an application that could aid in the success of Developers in the field. BugsyTracker is a user-friendly app that is simple in design to help in field that is very focus-driven. A user can describe a bug whilst also assigning the issue to another member on their team with relative ease.  



<hr></hr>

## Features
* Accepts input from developers on which bugs to address in their program
* Displays all current bugs that have been submitted
* Users may delete bugs from database after being addressed
* contact support section for questions about the application 
* Using formsubmit.co and axios for submitting a problem or message in customer support
* Conditional rendering implemented if there are no bugs posted
* Login and registration using Bcrypt and other dependencies

<hr></hr>

## Technologies Used

* React -- I decided to use React because of its popularity, making it a relatable library to use when developing an application
* MongoDB -- use to store data in the form of bugs and users created through the application
* Express -- enables connection to the frontend with minimal approach
* HTML, CSS, JSON -- used to create front end form creation script
* ChartJS -- used for creating charts to display the information from the backend

## Setup

N/A

<hr></hr>

## Usage

May be used in a software developer's workfield to keep a more organized list of issues for his/her team or self. Can assign bugs for personal project as well.



<hr></hr>

## Project Status

Bugsy tracker currently has a working form to post bugs. Those bugs can also be deleted from the list. The front-end support page has been created as well. 
Trying to implement Chartjs to show a chart of priority of bugs. Bar chart is added to Reports section. information from the database is prevelant on the page but is not rendering into the chart. Register for takes in data to the backened.



<hr></hr>

## Room for Improvement

* Code will be tested more thoroughly to prevent mistakes
* Files and folders will be labeled and organized far superior in the future
